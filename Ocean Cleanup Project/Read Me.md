# OCEAN CLEANUP USA DATA ANALYSIS

## The Dataset
Ocean Cleanup data was used and it was acquired from 
Connor Howard, Christopher Smith, Yixin Ye
(https://github.com/privat33r/dc20075-ocean)
This dataset consisted of 37904 rows and 62 columns



## Project Understanding
Exploration on this Ocean Cleanup Dataset for insights and potential for optimization of community cleanup and outreach efforts in the USA. This project was born out of my needs to improve on my data analytics skills and answer some questions which are:
1. Determining the totals for items collected, pounds of trash accumulated, miles covered, total participants and no. of bags used.
2. To determine the above mentioned according to year and what year did a lot more cleanup.
3. Understanding the top demographics based on different groups, grouped items, and state-wise data.
4. Determining what type of cleanup was more proficient and the percentage of adult to children participants.


## Project Tools
Tools used included; Microsoft Excel & Power BI


## Data Transformation
This methodology entails recognising inadequate data types, identifying absent values, resolving them accordingly, revising, eliminating, or substituting extraneous data, and building more columns and tables.
Going through the data, a removal of years not between 2015 - 2019 was removed as they were too insignificant and had quite a number of outlier values to provide insights from the data.


## Key Findings
1. 2017 was has the highest ocean clean up in terms of Items collected, pounds of trash accumulated and miles covered.
2. The year 2019, despite having lower participants compared to other years, a lot of miles were covered, but had less of trashed items and pounds than those years.
3. This means there has been significant improvement in trash disposal by the users of the ocean surrounding and something is making that possible.
4. The top 5 grouped items collected are Plastic Items, Foam Items, Cigarette, Other Items & Glass Items
5. A lot of people not associated to a group collect more items and covered more miles, but wasn't the highest in terms of pounds of trash accumulated
6. Folrida, California & North Carolina are the states that participated the most in the cleanup exercise
7. Carlifornia, Pennsylvania & Texas accumulated the highest pounds of trash etc.


## Visualisations
The visualisations are on this page as a pdf format, but you can also see & explore it on Power BI through the .pbix file in this folder 


## Conclusion
My participation in this project has been a learning experience, and I owe this to the massive dataset processed. It has increased my analytical proficiency and boosted my confidence in handling complex datasets.
The success and improvement of ocean and waterway cleanups depends on continued involvement of volunteers and outreach to communities
Garbage pickup in waterways improves quality of life for wildlife and the serenity of the area, as well as improving water quality over time.
Outreach to communities near waterways, watersheds, and beach communities can improve the number of volunteers and the success of cleanup operations.
Volunteer operations prevent the need for major government intervention and can greatly improve health and use of major bodies of water.
