The contents of this folder "Covid Practice Project" are my practice data analytics projects
This is a personal tutorial practice done to understand the basic use of some tools for Data Analytics

The Files are dataset for Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations and how it has impacted the world
The files used were sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths on 11th Jan, 2023
The tools used to execute the contents of the folder are;
  Excel
  SQL
  Tableau
Please note that this was done on the basis of understanding the basics of the above tools
There will be better projects with better analysis & visualizations to come.


Feel free to give criticism, comments and tasks to help improve my skills.
