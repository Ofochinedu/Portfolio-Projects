# AURORA BANK ANALYSIS

## Introduction
Welcome to the Aurora Bank Data Analysis! As a data analyst at one of the most dynamic financial institutions, I was tasked with uncovering critical insights from data on customers, transactions, cards, and merchant categories.

## Key Focus Area
1. Understand Customer Profiles: Explore customer demographics, financial health, and behaviors to unlock new opportunities for engagement.
2. Analyze Spending Trends: Uncover patterns and growth opportunities in transaction data.
3. Identify Risks: Spot potential red flags in rising debt, transaction errors, and fraudulent activity.


## Project Tools
Tools used included; Microsoft Excel & Power BI


## Data Transformation
This methodology entails recognising inadequate data types, identifying absent values, resolving them accordingly, revising, eliminating, or substituting extraneous data, and building more columns and tables.


## Visualisations
The visualisations are on this page as a pdf format, but you can also see & explore it on Power BI through the .pbix file in this folder 


## Key Findings
1. High-Risk Customers: 53.45% of customers are "High Risk," with an average DTI ratio of 172.91% and debt of $79,710.58.
2. Credit Scores: 46.55% of customers have "Good" credit (670-739), while only 8.3% are "Excellent" (800+).
3. Age & Risk: Gen X (44-59) has the highest "High Risk" and "Extreme Risk" levels, needing targeted strategies.
4. Transaction Types: Chip transactions dominate at 67.53%, showing a preference for secure, in-person payments.
5. Errors: "Insufficient Balance" is the most common error, especially for Gen X customers, indicating financial strain.
6. Fraud: High transaction amounts and counts flagged several clients for "Potential Fraud," requiring stricter monitoring.
7. Revenue Sources: Money transfers, grocery stores, and wholesale clubs are top contributors to revenue.
8. Gen X Profitability: Gen X leads in transaction volume, averaging $42 per transaction, driving significant revenue.
9. Credit Card Use: Customers have an average credit limit of $14,350 and 3.07 cards, indicating high credit exposure.


## Recommendations
1. Segment High-Risk Customers: Focus on customers with high debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and poor credit scores for targeted financial counseling or repayment restructuring.
2. Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs: Leverage insights from credit score levels and demographics to create tailored rewards or incentives for loyal, low-risk customers.
3. Streamline Fraud Detection: Implement automated fraud detection systems based on flagged "Potential Fraud" cases, considering transaction thresholds and client ID grouping.
4. Increase Revenue Streams: Introduce premium financial services for customers in the "Excellent" and "Very Good" credit score categories to maximize profitability.
5. Expand Profitability Analysis: Regularly evaluate the profitability of various credit products and revise interest rates or terms to reflect risk levels.
