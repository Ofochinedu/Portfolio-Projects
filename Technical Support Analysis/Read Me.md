# TECHNICAL SUPPORT ANALYSIS

## Introduction
In today’s world, businesses of all sizes rely heavily on technology for daily operations. Technical support plays a crucial role in maintaining these systems efficiently. This month's challenge provides a real-life scenario for you to explore: analyzing the functioning of technical support. It’s a great chance to learn from fellow participants, improve your analytical abilities, and broaden your professional experience.
This dataset consisted of 2330 rows and 22 columns


## Key Focus Area
#### Ticket Volume Trends:
1. Analyze daily, weekly and monthly volumes
2. Compare volumes between workdays and weekends
3. Examine ticket distribution during standard work hours versus after hours.
4. Recognize peak ticket creation times

#### Ticket Content and Resolution:
1. Identify trends in ticket topics
2. Investigate first response and resolution times against SLAs.
3. Compare support channels (chat, phone, email)
4. Analyze ticket geography for trends in submissions or product issues.

#### Performance Metrics:
1. Evaluate agent SLA adherence for first responses and resolutions.
2. Explore customer satisfaction rates across agents, topics and other categories.
3. Check how quickly tickets move through the resolution process.


## Project Tools
Tools used included; Microsoft Excel & Power BI


## Data Transformation
This methodology entails recognising inadequate data types, identifying absent values, resolving them accordingly, revising, eliminating, or substituting extraneous data, and building more columns and tables.


## Visualisations

## Key Findings
1. High SLA Resolution Violations: 34% of tickets breached resolution SLAs, indicating inefficiencies in resolving issues promptly.
2. Weekday & After-Hours Demand: 85% of tickets occurred on weekdays, with 63% created after standard work hours, highlighting off-peak support needs.
3. Agent Performance Disparity: Sheela Cutten resolved 254 tickets within SLA (top performer), while Connor Danielovitch and Nicola Wane had the highest SLA violations (133 each).
4. Slow Resolution Times: Average resolution took 33.74 hours, suggesting bottlenecks in closing tickets efficiently.
5. Channel Satisfaction Variability:
	Chat: Peaked at 4.43 satisfaction (October).
	Phone: Plummeted to 1.5 (August), signaling critical service gaps.
6. Geographic Hotspots: Germany, Italy, and Poland generated the highest ticket volumes, while Spain and Bulgaria had the lowest.
7. Product-Specific Trends:
	Ready-to-use Software: Peaked in July (101 tickets).
	Custom Software: Spiked in May (63 tickets).
8. Busiest Times: Mondays and 3 PM (Hour 15) had the highest ticket volumes; weekends and 11 AM were quietest.
9. Top Ticket Topics: Product setup (1,060 tickets) and pricing/licensing (954 tickets) dominated, while training requests were minimal (121 tickets).
10. SLA Compliance by Channel:
	Email: 1,234 tickets resolved within SLA.
	Chat: Highest satisfaction but 714 SLA violations.
11. First Response Efficiency: 87% of first responses met SLAs (26.56-minute average), but resolution delays persisted.


## Recommendations
1. Address SLA Resolution Bottlenecks: Reduce the 34% SLA violation rate by streamlining workflows for high-volume topics like product setup (1,060 tickets) and pricing/licensing (954 tickets). Implement automation tools to expedite repetitive tasks and prioritize agent training for underperformers (e.g., Connor Danielovitch, Nicola Wane).
2. Optimize Staffing During Peak Hours - Align support teams with demand spikes:
	Increase staffing on Mondays and during 3 PM (Hour 15).
	Extend after-hours coverage to handle 63% of tickets created outside work hours.
3. Revamp Phone Support Quality: Investigate the 1.5 satisfaction score (August) for phone support. Provide targeted training, script enhancements, and real-time escalation protocols to address critical gaps.
4. Leverage Regional & Product Insights:
	Allocate resources to high-volume regions (Germany, Italy, Poland) for faster resolution.
	Proactively address recurring issues with ready-to-use software (July peak: 101 tickets) and custom software (May spike: 63 tickets).
5. Enhance First Response-to-Resolution Alignment: Close the gap between 87% SLA compliance for first responses and slow 33.74-hour resolution times by assigning complex tickets to top performers like Sheela Cutten (254 resolved within SLA) and improving cross-team collaboration.
